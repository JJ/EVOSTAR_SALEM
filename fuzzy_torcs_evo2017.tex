\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
The Open Racing Car Simulator (TORCS) is one of the most popular car racing simulators, it was created by \textit{Eric Espié} and \textit{Christophe Guionneau} and currently \textit{Bernhard Wymann}, \textit{Christos Dimitrakakis}  and other contributors continue to develop it \cite{manual}.
The Open Racing Car Simulator)\cite{WebTORCS} is a free three-dimensional racing video game.
Even if it has not the graphic quality of commercial games, it presents several advantages for academic purposes, such as\cite{manuel}:
\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item  It lies between an advanced simulator, like recent commercial
	car racing games, and a fully customizable environment,
	like the ones typically used by computational
	intelligence researchers for benchmark purposes.
	\item  It features a sophisticated physics engine (aerodynamics,
	fuel consumption, traction,...) as well as a 3D graphics
	engine for the visualization of the races.
	\item  It was not conceived as a free alternative to commercial
	racing games, but it was specifically devised to make it
	as easy as possible to develop your own controller In fact, controllers are implemented as separated software with modular architecture ,so it is easy to develop a new controller and to plug
	it into the game.
	
\end{enumerate}
Even in simulation mode, like-human driving a car with a bot is a hard task where the driver has to control several actions such as the steer ,gear and brake/acceleration using the data of car and its environment.\\
Fuzzy logic \cite{abraham2001} with its adaptation and ability of imitating the human behaviour, is an interesting tool to design automatic TORCS drivers.\\ It could be integrated in any controller module (steer, gear, acceleration and brake, stuck) to give a human character to the bot driver \cite{CarRacing_Pelta09}, \cite{Guadarrama2008}.\\  

In this work , we will try to design fuzzy based controller to drive race cars in TORCS simulator. The proposed driver computes the steer and the target speed via two fuzzy controllers using the track sensors and consideration of opponents position in the race.\\
The remainder of this paper is organised as follows:\\
The second section is dedicated to present a state of the art  and related works while TORCS simulator is described in section 3.\\
The proposed  fuzzy controller is detailed in Section 4 and the simulation of the fuzzy controller in practice race and time trial and results of comparison with other controllers are given in section 5.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  STATE OF THE ART  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
\section{Background and State of the Art}
\label{subsec:soa}

A very good controller for TORCS is \cite{CarRacing_Pelta09}...

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  TORCS 
In the last years, several researchers have focused on driving a racing car using computational intelligence techniques \cite{evol},\cite{torcs2012}, \cite{neurone}  and especially fuzzy logic where \cite{CarRacing_Pelta09} tried to design a fuzzy controller for the the target speed while the other car actions were obtained by simple functions while in\cite{ho2008}, a  previous fuzzy controller was enhanced using context-dependent fuzzy set, the obtained controller was compared to existing driving 
techniques showing better performance.\\
In \cite{Guadarrama2008}, a fuzzy rule-based car controller for Car Racing Competition was built and tuned with coevolutionary genetic algorithms. Its results had been compared with  cooperative and competitive approaches to tuning parameters.
Authors of \cite{Fujii2008} had examined the performance of fuzzy rule-based systems in  high-level decision making of a car and the effect of sensory information.

\section{Problem Description: TORCS}
\label{subsec:torcs}
The Open Racing Car Simulator (TORCS)\cite{WebTORCS} is a standalone application where robots are built as separate modules loaded into the main memory when a race takes place \cite{Torcs3}.
The architecture of TORCS simulator is based on three ways \cite{manual}: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item TORCS is a client-server application, robots are run in external processes connected to the server running across by the UDP connections.\\
	\item The simulation is achieved in real time and  game ticks are approximately 20 ms of simulated time, the server sends the current sensors values to each robot and waits 10 ms (real time) to receive an action from the bot.
	If no action is happened, the simulation continues and the last action will be used.\\
	
	\item The TORCS software make a physical separation between the driver code and running server, it builds an abstract layer that gives complete freedom of choice of programming language that will be used for robots and limit access only to information defined by the designer.
\end{enumerate}
In competition, The robot perceives the racing environment through a number of sensors that provide information about the state of the car, the state of the race, opponents positions and track borders. These data enable the designer to form a base of solutions to achieve a typical driving. \cite{manuel}, \cite{torcs2}		\\		
Tables ~\ref{t1} presents a complete list of available sensors with a description of each one \cite{Torcs3}.\\

The TORCS driver bot is controlled through a  set of actuators: the steering wheel "Steer", the accelerator "accel", the brake pedal and the gearbox. In addition, a meta-action is available to request a restart of the race to the server. Table~\ref{tab2}  details the available actions and their representation \cite{torcs}.

\end{table}
A robot is a program run from TORCS that drives a car. It gets as input information about the current state of the car and its situation on the track. These collected data are used to compute actions to do in the next simulation tick; like steer, gear changes, acceleration or brake and clunch. A client may request a restart of the race by sending a special action on the server: Resatart or shutdown. \cite{manual}\\
The basic architecture of a controller consists of 5 simple modules (fig.\ref{archi}). This modular architecture  is a key factor to achieve good results.

TORCS comes with a simple driver often used to validate new designed controllers	 \cite{torcs}, \cite{torcs2}. It presents very basic functions for controlling the race car to give developers an idea of what the controller should look like. It includes simple functions to control the speed, steering angle and speed without dealing with opponents. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  FUZZY CONTROLLER  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
\section{Proposed Fuzzy Controller}
\label{subsec:fuzzy_controller}
The proposed controller has the same modular architecture as the simple driver where the target speed  and steer values are  computed via fuzzy controller using five position sensors.

\subsection{Fuzzy target speed}
To estimate the target speed  based on fuzzy rules, two cases are considered.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item If the car is in straight line, the target speed will take a maximum value (maxSpeed).\\
	\item If it is near a curve, the controller will decrease its current speed to a value included in the interval [minSpeed; maxSpeed] km/h.
\end{enumerate}
In case the car is off the track or near a curve, the brake system is activated where  the ABS and TCS will be loaded to avoid the car skidding.
\\
The obtained target speed will be used in calculating the value of acceleration.
\begin{equation}	
Gas(speed-Target_{speed})=-1+\frac{2}{1+e^{speed-Target_{speed}}}	
\end{equation}

Gas is for acceleration, Speed is the  current speed of the car.\\
Our fuzzy controller has 3 input values and one output: the target speed value(See figure \ref{AD}):

\end{figure}

The fuzzy driver (FD) is a Mamdani based fuzzy system \cite{Iancu2012} (See fig.\ref{AD}) with trapezoidal membership functions for input variables. It uses three values among the 19 of the track sensor (See fig.\ref{fig34}):

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Front = Track[9]  with angle = 0 , the front distance between the car and the border of track.
	\item M5 = max (Track[8]; Track[10])
	the max distance with +5 and  -5 angle.
	\item M10 = max (track[11]; track[7]) ,	the max distance with +10 and  -10 angle.
\end{enumerate}

	\begin{minipage}{10cm}
		\centering
		\caption{\footnotesize Fuzzy inputs.}
		\label{fig34}
	\end{minipage} 		
\end{figure}
Each input variable is represented by three membership functions Low, Medium and High\\
The description of fuzzy inputs and output are represented in table \ref{flouevar} .
	
	\begin{table}
		\label{flouevar}
		\caption{ Fuzzy variables description}
		\begin{tabular}{ |p{1cm}|p{2cm}|p{1.5cm}|p{2 cm}|p{1 cm}|p{1.5 cm}|p{1.5 cm}|}
			\hline
			{ \color{red} Variable }&
			{ \color{red}Range }&
			{ \color{red}Name}&  
			{ \color{red} MF } &
			{ \color{red} Low } &
			{ \color{red} Medium }&
			{ \color{red} High } 
			
			\\
			\hline
			Input & [0-100] m & Front & trapezoidal & [0-50] & [20-80] &[80-100]
			\\
			\hline
			Input & [0-100] m & M5 & trapezoidal &[0-40] & [10-70] & [40-100] 
			\\
			\hline
			Input & [0-100] m  & M10 & trapezoidal & [0-30] & [0-60] & [30-100]
			\\
			\hline 
			Output & [0-200]m/s & TS & singleton & / & / & /
			\\
			\hline 
		\end{tabular} 
	\end{table}

	The rules base is designed so that if the front distance is maximal, then target speed should be maximal, and this value should be less when  the frontal distance is lower. The fuzzy rules are listed below:
	\\
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item If Front is High Then TargetSpeed is TS1
		\item If Front is Medium Then TargetSpeed is TS2
		\item If Front is Low and M5 is High Then TargetSpeed is TS3
		\item If Front is Low and M5 is Medium Then TargetSpeed is TS4
		\item If Front is Low and M5 is Low and M10 is High Then TargetSpeed is TS5
		\item If Front is Low and M5 is Low and M10 is Medium Then TargetSpeed is TS6
		\item  If Front is Low and M5 is Low and M10 is Low Then TargetSpeed is TS7
		\\
		In addition, a crisp rule is added to rule base to obtain a maximum value of the target speed when the three input variables are as big as possible: \\
		\item If Front = Maxdistspeed or M5 = Maxdistspeed or M10 = Maxdistspeed Then TargetSpeed = Maxspeed	
		
	\end{enumerate}
	The output value (target speed) is encoded by seven singletons.
	
	\subsection{Fuzzy Steer control}	
	We can use another fuzzy controller to control the Steer to estimate and determine the target position of the car:\\
	if the car is straight line then it will take as target position half width of the race track.	
	
	If the car is near a right curve,it will approach the path leading to the right, with a space between the car and the border of the track to avoid the loss of control and shocks .The same if the car is near a left curve. \\
	
	Detection of curves is based on the sensor values (M10, M5, front).
	the rule base is presented as follows:\\
	\begin{itemize}
		
		\item If Front is High Then steer is S1
		\item If Front is Medium Then steer is S2
		\item If Front is Low and M5 is High Then steer is S3
		\item If Front is Low and M5 is Medium Then steer is S4
		\item If Front is Low and M5 is Low and M10 is High Then steer is S5
		\item If Front is Low and M5 is Low and M10 is Medium Then steer is S6
		\item  If Front is Low and M5 is Low and M10 is Low Then steer is S7
		\\
	\end{itemize}

\section{Simulation Results}
\label{subsec:results}

In this section we present all the experiments that we performed in order to measure the performance of our "FD" controller .
We first, describe the methodology we have used and next, we present the experimental results of the implementation of the Fuzzy driver, with opponents and
using special criteria in each case. \\
We have established a set of tests to measure the performance of the controller "AD". We compared the newly developed Controller with existing methods: the simple driver. We will run every controller in several race tracks. 
\subsection{Simulation settings}
TORCS provides different tracks to choose from. These race tracks are designed by different developers in order to test the performance of the controllers on different difficulty circuits and on different types of roads.\\

In our case, we chose three of road tracks, a dirt road, and an oval track.\\


On oval tracks, E-Track5 seems to be the most interesting, as it has curves in both directions. On dirt roads, Dirt1 has a good variety of curves. For road tracks, we selected three tracks: Forza, E-Road and CG-Speedway Number1. Table \ref{Tabtrack}  presents the properties and description of each selected track.\\

\subsubsection{ Cars settings}

SCR 1 server is a NASCAR car and member of the SCR Server team (A team can used different types of car as  car1-stock1, car1-tbr1 ...).\\
A Sprint Cup Series NASCAR-type car weighs at least 1542 kg for 850 horses with . The engine is a V8 with  $ 5,866 cm ^ 3 $. Its chassis is tubular type. It has a Borg-Warner gearbox with four-speed for road circuits.\\

In our simulations, we used the car "car1-tbr1" which has a weight of 1150 KG, max fuel: 94 KG, length= 4.25 m and a width of 1.94 m.
\subsubsection{Controllers settings}
To validate the fuzzy controllers, we have considered the following controllers:\\
AD1: Fuzzy target speed  controller \\
AD2: Fuzzy steer and speed controller \\
AD5: Fuzzy target speed  controller with opponent consideration \\
SD: Simple driver \\

We conducted a series of experiments to measure the performance of the best version control in some race tracks (05 tracks in table \ref{Tabtrack} ).

\subsection{Results of 20 lap practice race}
In this case, we tested our controllers in a 20 laps practice race in the four tracks:\\
	
In this section, we set the distance to 20 laps for each track and for each controller.

The table \ref{Result1r} shows that among the four drivers, the minimum time has been reached by the AD5 controller in each of the five tracks, this was due to the steering unit of the target. The target position allows the car to adjust safely the required steering angle  with the maximum speed so the controller AD5 gave the best time.
\\
However, taking a smaller target angle required a greater distance to cover by car by taking a less efficient trajectory. In addition, the number of times the car was off the road on Dir1 and Forza was higher for AD5 and, accordingly, the time that the car has passed out of the track was potentially higher than the other controllers.\\	
Thus, higher damages happened after the collision with the outer walls of the track when the car is off the track. The simple SD driver finished the race without damage, while AD5 was able to complete all the tracks safely except the Dir1t4 and Forza circuit where the damage is a little high for the AD1 driver (fig.\ref{resultat1}). For the fuel consumption, it  depends on  shocks rate and category of tracks.

\subsection{Time trial race}
Now, we set the race stopping criterion to 300s, so each controller is run in a time trial race where the race is stopped after 300s and the current distances are compared.
Results are in Table \ref{resulta9}.

\subsection{Real race}
Our main goal is to test the performance of "AD5" in a race, and answer the following questions: Could we have a perfect driving in a race with "AD5" only with the track borders sensors? Can we win the race with AD5?\\
In this context we tested "AD5" in 5 tracks against berwin,bt, damned, inferno and tita teams.\\
After the launch of the race "AD5" against the 10 cars of each team  for 20 laps in each track we obtained the following results (see table \ref{resultat31})

From Table \ref {resultat31}, we noticed that our controller has won a race only in some types of tracks such as "E-track5" category "Oval track".\\

When our controller is in parallel with his opponent, and the distance between them is smaller, and they are in a smaller width track,  there is a possibility of  damage.
\\

According to damage results, despite our controller can win the race on the E-track5 but it had a higher crash rates in the majority of cases. We observed also that in the majority of cases our car is very slow compared to the other cars in each team.
